### About PersonalInfoMngmt

The name is short for Personal Information Management. The functions that allow user to costomise columns in Employee List page are going to be added in the existing system.

I designed 3 main features:

1. Editable column layout
2. Custom columns
3. Download table

The features are divided into the following tasks:

- [x] Download table as Excel file (by [ExcelExportJs](https://github.com/tarunbatta/ExcelExportJs))
- [x] Sticky table header
- [x] Display selected columns
- [x] Create layout
- [x] Edit layout
- [x] Delete layout
- [x] Create column
- [x] Define metric
- [x] Read the definition and calculate the result
- [x] Maybe I need to change the data in database for demonstration
- [x] Check if the layout name exists
- [x] Check if the column name exists
- [ ] Only show columns with data types like INT and FLOAT
- [ ] Allow user to define the format of the result
- [ ] *Support other download format*
- [ ] Testing! Testing! Testing!
