### About InfoManager

Personal Information Management is the most basic function in COMPANY. This project requires me to improve this function based on user's request, which is allowing user to costomize columns in Employee List page.

To fulfill the request, I designed 3 features:

1. Editable column layout
2. Custom columns
3. Download table

The features I designed can benefit users in many situations which is indicated in the file called *Catalog*.

To achieve the goal, there are many tasks I need to complete:

- [x] Download table as Excel file (by [ExcelExportJs](https://github.com/tarunbatta/ExcelExportJs))
- [x] Sticky table header
- [x] Display selected columns
- [x] Create layout
- [x] Edit layout
- [x] Delete layout
- [x] Create column
- [x] Define metric
- [x] Read the definition and calculate the result
- [x] Maybe I need to change the data in database for demonstration
- [x] Check if the layout name exists
- [x] Check if the column name exists
- [ ] Only show columns with data types like INT and FLOAT
- [ ] Allow user to define the format of the result
- [ ] *Support other download format*
- [ ] Testing! Testing! Testing!
